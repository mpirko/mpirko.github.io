            <h2>My Favorite Chili Recipe (May 14, 2023)</h2>
            <p>
As a passionate cook, I absolutely love exploring different cultures and incorporating their unique flavors into my dishes. Cooking is my go-to activity for decompressing after a long day, and I relish the opportunity to share my cultural heritage through my cooking with others. As the daughter of Hungarian immigrants, paprika is a must-have ingredient in most of my recipes, including this delicious chili recipe I want to share with you.

Here is a one-pot hearty vegetarian chili recipe I cannot help but share. The beans, vegetables, and spices help make the dish satisfying and filling. Gochujang, a fermented Korean red pepper paste, adds a lot of depth and can be found at Asian grocery stores or Trader Joe’s. I strongly recommend adding this ingredient if it is accessible to you and adjusting the spice level to your preference by modifying the amount of chili powder, gochujang, or chili flakes. Adding tortilla chips will provide an extra crunch to the chili.            </p>

              <p>
The total time needed for this recipe is approximately 1 hour and 5 minutes, with 10 minutes for chopping the vegetables and adding the ingredients and 55 minutes of combined cooking time. Despite the long time this recipe requires, it is low effort. Sit back and let the stove do the work! I can attend to other tasks while waiting for the meal to cook, looking forward to the delicious reward afterward.            </p>
                <p>
<b>Step 1: Warm Up Time.</b> To start the chili, obtain a large pot or Dutch oven and heat 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil over medium heat. Add two onions and two cloves of garlic and sauté until the onions are translucent, which should take approximately 5 minutes. Next, add two carrots and one bell pepper of your preferred color and continue to sauté until the vegetables are slightly softened, which should take about another 5 minutes.
            </p>
           <p>
<b>Step 2: Spicing it Up.</b> Add 1 tablespoon of chili powder, 1 tablespoon of gochujang, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1 teaspoon of oregano, 1 teaspoon of paprika, ½ teaspoon of chili flakes, ½ teaspoon of cumin, and 1 teaspoon lemon juice to the pot and stir to combine. If you don’t want to be precise it isn’t necessary. Lightly dusting the top with each of the spices one to two times should suffice. Keep in mind this recipe makes a lot of chili, so don’t be afraid to add more spices later on. With each addition, the ingredients really take on the flavors from the seasoning.            </p>
           <p>
<b>Step 3: Spilling the Beans.</b> Add 1 can of black beans (rinsed and drained), 1 can of kidney beans (rinsed and drained), and one 24-ounce jar of marinara sauce to the pot and stir to combine. Bring the chili to a simmer with the lid on and let it cook for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally.           </p>
  <p>
<b>Step 4: The Final Countdown.</b> After cooking for 45 minutes, taste the chili and add more spices/seasonings and maybe lemon juice to your liking.  Serve the chili hot and, if desired, with sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese, and tortilla chips for dipping. With this chili recipe, your guests will be sure to cheer you on for the delicious food!         </p>
