    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a former MD-PhD student looking to pivot my career towards the tech sector as I've found such work more compatible with my personal interests and life-style. At the moment, I'm building-up my skills in data analysis and machine-learning. My skills are always growing and include Python, R, SQL, Github, Excel and ,as you can see (hopefully) some HTML. Feel free to check out my <a href="projects.html">projects</a>.

            Two and a half years of undergraduate research on <em>Generating a Recombinant Protein for Transgenic Insertion into Bombyx mori</em> under Dr. Malcom Frasier
