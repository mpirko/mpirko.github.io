    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a former MD-PhD student looking to pivot my career towards the tech sector as I've found such work more compatible with my personal interests and life-style. At the moment, I'm building-up my skills in data analysis and machine-learning. My skills are always growing and include Python, R, SQL, Github, Excel and, as you can see (hopefully) some HTML. Feel free to check out my <a href="projects.html">projects</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a B.S. in biochemistry and a minor in data-science from Notre Dame, half a year of medical school coursework at the Stritch School of Medicine (Loyola), as well as four years of experience in medical research including the following in reverse chronological order:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A year-long post-baccalaureate at NIH performing <em>Molecular Characterization of Human B Cell Responses to HPV-VLP</em> under Dr. Susan Pierce
        </li>
        <li>
            Two and a half years of undergraduate research on <em>Generating a Recombinant Protein for Transgenic Insertion into Bombyx mori</em> under Dr. Malcolm Frasier
        </li>
        <li>
            A three-month internship on <em>Attenuation of Inflammation Results in Seizure Reduction and Neuroprotection in TNFR1 Knockout and Low Inoculum TMEV</em> under Dr. Charles Howe
