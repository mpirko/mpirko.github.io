            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I am a former MD/PhD candidate who is now transitioning into the field of data analytics. I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry and a minor in Data Science. My strong mathematical skills and problem-solving abilities led me to pursue a degree in Biochemistry, which involves a deep understanding of the chemical processes within living organisms.

During my time in medical school, I found that traditional medicine involved a lot of memorization and relied heavily on tried and true methods. While I found this process to be valuable towards patient care as it is safest to use well-established methods on a patient, I realized that my skills and interests are better suited for a career that involves more critical thinking and innovation. Data analytics is the perfect fit as it allows me to use my strong analytical skills to provide insights and help others make informed decisions based on data.

My passion for data analytics comes from the fact that it allows her to help people in a different way than medicine. By analyzing data and providing insights, I am able to make a positive impact on a company's success and help drive their decision-making processes. I enjoy the challenge of working with data and deriving novel solutions from it, which is something that traditional medicine does not offer in the same way. My interest in data analytics has inspired me to continue to learn and grow in the field and I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
